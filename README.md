# salt-master
🐳 Automated build for Salt Master Docker image using Debian as a base. Fetches the latest stable version daily from the official Salt Project repository (`packages.broadcom.com`) using GitHub Actions and publishes it to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). Image tags include the specific Salt version (e.g., `3007.1`) and `latest`.
